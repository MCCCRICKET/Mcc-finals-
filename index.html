    <h2>Team Leo</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      MCC Titles: <strong>5</strong> (Last white ball title <em>2013</em>, last red ball title <em>2022</em>). Since 2013, Leo has lost 5 finals and 2 semifinals.

      <p class="question">Question for Captain <strong>Pragadeesh</strong>:</p>
      <p class="answer">
        ‚ÄúPragadeesh, Leo has a rich history but has faced heartbreak in recent finals, losing 5 since 2013 despite some brilliant campaigns. As a young captain leading from the front, how are you preparing yourself and your team mentally and tactically to break this finals jinx and finally lift the MCC title again this year?‚Äù
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Thank you for that question. I believe finals are not just about skills but about handling pressure with confidence and clarity. Over the years, Leo has come close but fell short, and those experiences have only strengthened our resolve. As captain, I focus on building a fearless mindset in the squad ‚Äî encouraging every player to trust their preparation and embrace the moment. We have worked hard on our strategies, from adapting to pitch conditions to flexible batting orders and aggressive field placements. Personally, I remind myself that runs and wickets come from calm decision-making and positive energy. We respect LionFit‚Äôs strength, but we also believe this is our time to rewrite the story. Winning this title would be a culmination of hard work, team unity, and the passion that every Leo player brings to the field. I am confident we will give our best and make the fans proud.

      <p class="question">Question for Coach <strong>Richie</strong>:</p>
      <p class="answer">
        ‚ÄúRichie, considering the emotional weight of five final defeats since 2013, how have you helped the team to maintain confidence and resilience? What‚Äôs your approach to ensuring Leo‚Äôs players perform at their peak under final pressure?‚Äù
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Finals are the ultimate test of a team‚Äôs character and mental strength, and we have had our share of heartbreaks since 2013. My approach has always been to focus on creating a calm and focused environment where players can express themselves without fear of failure. We emphasize preparation, scenario planning, and mental conditioning as much as skill training. I work closely with our sports psychologists to build resilience and help players learn to stay in the moment, block out distractions, and manage pressure effectively. We also encourage leadership at all levels so the responsibility doesn‚Äôt rest solely on the captain‚Äôs shoulders. This way, when the spotlight hits, every player is ready to perform their role with confidence. Our recent training camps focused heavily on high-pressure simulations to replicate final match tension. I believe this combination of mental and tactical readiness is key to breaking our final‚Äôs jinx and bringing the MCC title back home to Leo.

    <h2>Team LionFit</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      MCC Titles: <strong>7</strong> (Last white ball title <em>2024</em>, red ball title <em>2000</em>). LionFit has lost only the 2011 final and remains unbeaten in all other finals.

      <p class="question">Question for Captain <strong>Sanjay</strong>:</p>
      <p class="answer">
        ‚ÄúSanjay, LionFit enters this final with a formidable record, having won 7 MCC titles and rarely losing at the final hurdle. How do you manage the expectations and pressure of maintaining this legacy, especially against a high-momentum Leo side?‚Äù
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Thank you. Being part of a team with such a rich legacy brings pride but also great responsibility. We understand that every final is a new challenge and no past victories guarantee future success. My focus is on keeping the team grounded, concentrating on our strengths, and playing one ball at a time. We respect Leo and know they have been in great form throughout the tournament. Our approach is to keep our energy high and trust the preparation we have done as a unit. Pressure is part of the game, but it becomes manageable when you back your skills and support your teammates. I believe our consistency in finals comes from a strong team culture, focus on discipline, and adaptability. We aim to continue our legacy and make the MCC proud again this year.

      <p class="question">Question for Coach <strong>Richie</strong>:</p>
      <p class="answer">
        ‚ÄúRichie, LionFit‚Äôs final record is enviable, but every match brings new challenges. How do you prepare your players to handle the intense pressure of a final against a determined Leo side that‚Äôs eager to break their drought?‚Äù
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        LionFit‚Äôs excellent finals record comes from years of building a strong team culture focused on consistency, discipline, and collective responsibility. We prepare our players not only physically but also mentally for the unique pressures finals bring. Our sessions include mindfulness training, scenario-based tactical drills, and reviewing past finals to learn lessons without being burdened by them. Against a strong Leo side, it‚Äôs vital that we maintain composure and stick to our game plans but remain flexible to adapt as the match unfolds. Communication is crucial ‚Äî we ensure players support each other and stay connected, which reduces individual pressure. We stress the importance of enjoying the challenge rather than fearing it. This mindset, coupled with thorough preparation, has been the backbone of our success and will help us approach this final with confidence and focus.
